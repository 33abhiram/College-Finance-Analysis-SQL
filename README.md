## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of my financial activities during my freshman year of college. I was curious about how I managed my finances during my first year being independent, so I decided to use my data analytics knowledge to find out, and definitely learnt a lot!

To begin, I transformed my bank statments into a reliable csv file by throughly cleaning the data and importing it to MySQL Workbench, where I ran several queries to examine the raw data. Then, after meticulous logical and statistical analysis methods, I took my final SQL queries over to Tableau Public to create visualizations of my results. My final output can be viewed as a user-friendly dashboard on Tableau Public server: 

## Data Dictionary
transaction_id - unique id for each transaction

year - year of transaction

month - month of transaction

category - field of spending

amount - transaction amount

## Results
The results of this project have illuminated crucial insights into my financial behavior. Through data analysis and visualization, it became evident that implementing a well-defined monthly budget is essential for more effective financial management and the need to curtail shopping expenses and maintain a minimum balance was underscored - it was clear that there was room for improvement in these areas. I found that, while some financial resources were not optimally utilized, the knowledge and tools derived from this analysis will serve as a valuable guide and enable me to become more financially responsible.
